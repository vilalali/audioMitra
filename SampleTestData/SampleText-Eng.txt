Throughout the transformation process, AudioMitra allows for the optional collaboration between human intervention and machine operation. This collaborative approach ensures the authenticity and reliability of the transformations performed. The degree of human and machine involvement is tailored to meet specific workflow requirements, with the balance dictated by the desired level of accuracy and the nature of the transformations needed.
